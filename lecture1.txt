who gets the cake

card shuffling
    if split k cards, there are k-1 ways to split it
    k cards would have k! combinations but some combination would be missings if only shuffle once

sudoku
    9x9 cells with 9 numbers
    in a row, column, or 3x3 square, no number can repeat

Huffman Compression
    as the transmission of file is slow you have compress it.
    1. lossless compression
    2. lossy compression

    more frequent characters should have fewer bits
    ps: binary tree
        at the bottom, use more bits
        at the top, use fewer bits

write a program - using gcc

gcc myprogram.c
a.out

gcc myprogram.c -o 

makefile - 了解一下这是干嘛的
use #ifdef MESSAGE - #ifdef 是干嘛的

stdlib - define EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS

makefile is a tool in linux - how i want to build my file and how i want to test my program

test coverage allows you to know which line of your program has not been used

when compiling: a.c -> object file a.o -link> executable



add.o:add.C

$(gcc)$(TESTFLAGS) -c add.c (what does the TESTFLAGS mean and where it comes from)
