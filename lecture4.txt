Learn gdb to debug (go to hotseat)

emacs is a text editor (vs code is fine)

use file eliminate to test if it's an executable

To go to gdb from text editor, press escape and x, then type gdb 

P.S. you could use a gdb cheat sheet

gdb command

b - a break point, the program would stop at the break point, it would stop at that line but not executing it
    b eliminate.c:24
    info b - show the information of all the break points

bt - back trace? what does it do? f 0 is current frame, and f 1 is who calls it

r - run specific file

c - continue

n - you go to next line

display (variable) - it works like a print but not actual print it
delete display - delete the display function

print - similar to the print command in C

info - get info
