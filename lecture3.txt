Stack Memory
store: 

1. return location
2. arguments
3. local variables
4. value address


address are always different 
computer only knows the addresses and symbols

A function can see only its frame

a pointer is variable storing address

int t = 5;
int * p = & t; //* means a pointer, & means get the address

you can never change the address

Pointer

LHS - modify the value
RHS - read the value at the address


mean of *

1. type *p =  ;     create a pointer
2. * p =   ;        LHS
3. int s = * p;     RHS
4. int t = 5 * 9;


Data Types
    - specify the information and operations
    - specify the amount of info in there
    - people want to create new data types

Don't mix up the integer   

can't change address; only values; can't mix pointer with non-pointer
